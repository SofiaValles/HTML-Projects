  <h2>ROCK REVIEW</h2>
  <p>2002, New York Times Z</p>
  <p>Punk rockers once claimed they wanted to reject all things conventional.<br> But the organizers of the Vans Warped Tour have succeeded by reversing the old credo with a twist: they embrace all things conventionish.<br>On Saturday, Randalls Island played host to 17,500 young people who wandered from booth to booth, clutching plastic bags full of free or cut-rate merchandise.</p>
